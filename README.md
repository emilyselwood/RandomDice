Simple starting project with Scala and JavaFX 2.1

All the basic stuff working, scene loading, application start up, and a few bells and whisles left in.

You'll need to point intelliJ at your JavaFX installation 

If you get errors on start up about the *.fxml file not being found you need to add *.fxml and *.csv to
the list of files that intelliJ copies into the build directory. Options > Compiler > Resource Patterns

Have fun.
